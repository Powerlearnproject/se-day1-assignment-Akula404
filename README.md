#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems and involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.This would be appropriate where there are large infrustructural projects,
    for regulatory compliance projects that require strict documentation and in manufucturing or hardware developments where changes later may be costly
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change and can be appropriate for software and app developments, web developments and for innovations

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. Adopt Agile Methodology – Use iterative development (Scrum, Kanban) to accommodate 
    changes in manageable sprints. Prioritize Requirements – Use MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have) to categorize features based on importance and maintain regular feedback loops with     
    clients/users to ensure alignment.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. Can be countered by setting realistic deadlines and also automating testing and 
    deployment
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. Can be countered by By refactoring code, following 
    coding standards and using code reviews and pair programming. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software and helps in identifying and fixing bugs early in the development process thereby reducing overall costs by catching issues early
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. It helps ensure different software modules work together correctly reducing risks of miscommunication between different 
  software parts
- System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. It validates the complete system's functionality, performance, security and compliance thus helping identify system-wide defects thst might not 
  have appeared during unit and integrated testing
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This ensures software meets business and user expectations before deployment and detects usability issues 
  from an end user experience

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is essentially the art and science of crafting effective instructions, or "prompts," to elicit desired outputs from generative artificial intelligence (AI) models. It ensures AI is bug free and runs faster helping get clear and accurate answers from AI and also reduces cost of AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - " Tell me about Kenya " - This is too broad, as  Kenya has many aspects e.g culture, economy, geography and politics 
Improved prompt - "Provide a brief overview of Kenya, focusing on its geography, major economic activities, and key tourist attractions" - Is more specific, has a clearer focus and is concise and actionable
